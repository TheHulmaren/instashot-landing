    <h1>Instashot Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: 2024-07-06 4:14 AM GMT+9</p>
    <p>
      Welcome to Instashot! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of
      Instashot ("Service"), an AI portrait generator that can be trained on
      user-provided face images. By accessing or using Instashot, you agree to
      be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not
      use our Service.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
      By accessing and using Instashot, you agree to comply with and be bound by
      these Terms. These Terms may be updated by us from time to time without
      notice to you. Your continued use of the Service after any changes are
      made will constitute your acceptance of the revised Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>
      Instashot provides an AI-based service that generates portraits based on
      face images uploaded by users. The Service may include various features
      and functionalities, which may be added, modified, or removed at any time
      at our discretion.
    </p>

    <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
    <p>
      To use certain features of Instashot, you may need to create an account.
      You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account
      information and for all activities that occur under your account. You
      agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the
      registration process and to update such information as necessary to keep
      it accurate, current, and complete.
    </p>

    <h2>4. User-Provided Content</h2>
    <h3>4.1 Uploading Images</h3>
    <p>
      By uploading images to Instashot, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide,
      royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable license to use, reproduce,
      modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from,
      distribute, and display such images for the purpose of providing and
      improving the Service.
    </p>

    <h3>4.2 Representations and Warranties</h3>
    <p>
      You represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary licenses,
      rights, consents, and permissions to grant the above license to us. You
      further represent and warrant that the uploaded images do not infringe,
      misappropriate, or violate any third-party rights, including privacy and
      intellectual property rights.
    </p>

    <h3>4.3 Use of Third-Party Photos</h3>
    <p>
      While you are permitted to upload photos of individuals other than
      yourself, you should obtain explicit consent from those individuals before
      doing so. Uploading photos of third parties without their permission may
      result in complaints or legal actions, and you agree to be solely
      responsible for any issues arising from the use of such photos. Instashot
      is not liable for any unauthorized use of third-party photos, and you
      agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims, losses, or
      damages arising from your violation of this provision.
    </p>

    <p class="important">
      We do not accept photos of minors. If you do, this can result in a
      permanent ban or legal consequences.
    </p>

    <h3>4.4 Appropriate Prompting</h3>
    <p>
      When generating photos, you agree to use the Service in a respectful and
      lawful manner. This includes refraining from:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Using prompts that are harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing,
        defamatory, vulgar, obscene, or otherwise objectionable.
      </li>
      <li>Creating content that is unlawful or promotes illegal activities.</li>
      <li>
        Using prompts that impersonate any person or entity or falsely state or
        misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Fees and Payments</h2>
    <p>
      Instashot is a subscription-based service where users can enjoy a 14-day
      free trial period. Upon the expiration of the free trial, users will be
      automatically billed according to the subscription plan they selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plan upgrades are processed instantly, with appropriate prorations applied
      to ensure that users are only charged for the time they use the upgraded
      plan during the current billing cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plan downgrades will take effect from the next billing period. This means
      that users will continue to have access to the features of their current
      plan until the end of the current billing cycle, after which the
      downgraded plan will be applied.
    </p>
