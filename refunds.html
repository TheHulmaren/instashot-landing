    <p>Last Updated: 2024-07-06 5:07 AM GMT+9</p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
      At Instashot, we strive to provide the best AI portrait generation service
      to our users. If you are not entirely satisfied with your purchase, we're
      here to help.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Refunds</h2>
    <p>
      We offer refunds for unused "credits" on a proportional basis for the
      current month. "Credits" are a virtual currency that users receive monthly
      by subscribing to our plan. These credits do not accumulate or carry over
      to the next month.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Conditions for Refunds</h2>
    <p>Refunds will be considered under the following conditions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Unused Credits:</strong> Refunds will be provided for any unused
        credits for the current month on a proportional basis.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Billing Errors:</strong> If you were billed incorrectly, such as
        being charged twice for the same service, please contact us for a
        refund.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How to Request a Refund</h2>

        days.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Refund Process</h2>
    <p>
      If your refund request is approved, we will initiate a refund to your
      original method of payment. The time it takes to receive the refund may
      vary depending on your payment provider's policies.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update our Return and Refund Policy from time to time. We will
      notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page. You are
      advised to review this policy periodically for any changes.
